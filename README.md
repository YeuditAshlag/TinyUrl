# TinyUrl
The TinyUrl service is a tool for shortening URL addresses. The service is intended for business customers who post links to landing pages and web files. After the customer has registered for the service, he can enter the URL of a landing page, website or web file (for example, a PDF guide saved in Google Drive) and create a shortened url for it.
